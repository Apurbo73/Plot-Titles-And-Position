A **DataFrame** is a core data structure in the pandas library, used to store and manage data in a **tabular form** with rows and columns, much like an Excel sheet or a SQL table. Each column has a label and can hold data of a different type, such as numbers, text, or dates, while each row has an index that uniquely identifies it. DataFrames make it easy to organize, access, and manipulate data, allowing operations like filtering, sorting, adding or deleting columns, performing calculations, and even plotting graphs directly. Essentially, a DataFrame provides a structured and flexible way to work with complex datasets efficiently in Python.
